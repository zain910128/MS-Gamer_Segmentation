# MS Video Gamer Segmentation

### Project objectives

This project will aim to answer the following questions:

    Is there any pattern in the choice of games played by teenagers?
    Does the choice of one category of games imply the choice for another category of games?
    Can we form clusters of gamer types with distinct traits?

### Benefits

If we are able to form distinct clusters and identify common traits, this information can be valuable for various things such as to:

    Improve targeting of marketing campaigns
    Create more games for clusters having larger number of gamers
    Track the change in distribution of gamers across the clusters over time and adapt business strategies accordingly
